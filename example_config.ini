[settings]
# This section controls the dedicated Google Cloud Translation service.
# These settings are ONLY used if 'translation_model' below is set to 'google_translate'.

# use_advanced_api: A true/false switch for the translation API version.
#   true  = Use the Advanced (v3) API, which supports features like glossaries. Requires a 'gcp_project_id'.
#   false = Use the Basic (v2) API for simple, direct translations.
use_advanced_api = true

# gcp_project_id: Your project ID from the Google Cloud Platform console.
# This is required for the Advanced (v3) API and for Vertex AI.

# gcp_region: The cloud region for Vertex AI services.
# 'us-central1' is a good default region for Gemini models.

[gemini_settings]
# This section controls the Gemini generative model, which can understand
# nuanced instructions for translating into different dialect styles.

# translation_model: The master switch to select the translation engine.
#   gemini           = Use the Gemini model. This enables the 'target_dialect' option.
#   google_translate = Use the dedicated Google Cloud Translation service (controlled by the [settings] section above).
translation_model = gemini

# target_dialect: Controls the style of the translation when using the 'gemini' model.
#   none     = Standard Central Thai without any special prompting.
#   northern = Instructs the model to use a Northern Thai (Lanna) style.
#   southern = Instructs the model to use a Southern Thai (Pak Tai) style.
target_dialect = northern

# gemini_model: The specific model to use for generating translations.
#   'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' is recommended for a balance of speed, cost, and quality.
#   'gemini-1.5-pro-latest' is a more powerful (and more expensive) alternative.
gemini_model = gemini-1.5-flash-latest


[secrets]
# This section stores private credentials. The actual 'config.ini' file
# containing these secrets should be ignored by Git.

# google_api_key: Your private API key for using the Gemini API.
# This is no longer used by the Vertex AI version of the script but is kept for reference.
